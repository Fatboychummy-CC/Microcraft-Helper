# Microcraft Helper

## Description

This program aids in crafting items in modpacks that have a large number of
items and a large amount of crafting required (colloquially known as
"microcrafting").

You can feed it items and their crafting recipes (even if they are recursive),
then ask it to craft a specific item. It will give you a crafting plan including
all the items you need to craft and how many of each you need (and, if using 
machines, which machines to use).
